# EmployeeDatabase
The purpose of this project was to get a jump start on understanding databases with insertion of data through user input.


The reason for using Windows Form Application with this project was solely so that I could start somewhere with this idea, implement the database and the code behind, then begin to step through and analyze the code to see how it works.

I am currently still running through and anaylizing this code because I am not yet finished with strong fundamentals in C#. SQL is relatively new to me. Therefore, this project gave me an excellent look on the big picture of a basic application with database, but I am still hazy to some concepts.

Next part of this project will be to implement deletion of data from the form.
